Tasks to do

1. time-series plot
2. time-variation of the timelapse Bar
3. clickable function/selection of circle, to indicate their time-series plots.
4. enable multiple selections of circles on-click.
5. plotting multiple time-series: voltage and calcium signals.



#1. Time-series visualization - lineplot.
#2. Adding brush dynamics?


// Handling BRUSH:
When you select a group of cells, change their class.
Then d3.selectAll(className) --> display their linePlots on the savePlotting div.

lineplot_transitioning - via chaining effects! : to indicate that there's an implicit change in scale and values occuring.


Brush, select circles, change the class id of these circles.

//Extract set of data from elements?: MultilinePlot?
